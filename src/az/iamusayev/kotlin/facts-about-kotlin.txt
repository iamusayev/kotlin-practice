Created in 2011 by JetBrains
Fully compatible with Java (compiles to the same byte-code and runs on the same JVM)
One project can have both Java and Kotlin code and use each other
Kotlin can import and use any existing Java library

Kotlin is the standard for Android development.
Spring applications can be written in Kotlin too
Kotlin code is about twice as compact as Java code

Kotlin has many handy features that Java doesn't have.
Kotlin is getting more popular every year, but before learning Kotlin it's better to learn Java first (so you'll have a better understanding of what Kotlin simplifies)
